# menu-wireguard
A simple Rofi or Dmenu application for managing Wireguard VPN connections.

This script is simple and fast.  It begins with the option to make or break a VPN connection based on the Wireguard protocol.  It uses fuzzy search to present the user with a list of Wireguard configs for making a connection or a list of Wireguard interfaces to put down.

The script has been developed and tested in Ubuntu GNU/Linux; it should work in other distributions.

### Dependencies:
bash
rofi
wireguard
